+   The "_____ MM in other parts of NZ" sections have repetitions of many (but not
    all) people; this seems to be related to how many meetings they're related to,
    which means there's a problem with the way they're extracted. A hacky fix would
    be to apply "uniq" after sorting, but I'd really rather find out how they get
    into the list multiple times to begin with.

+   NBSP (used in phone numbers) is behaving like ZWNJ, while ZWNJ is being
    completely ignored:
      + Phone numbers are being split on the NBSP's (noting that \N{NBSP} =~ /\s/)
      + NBSP's are not showing as spaces (probably a rendering issue; perhaps
        substitute \x20 during text-flow?
      + Lists are not being split on ZWNJ's (noting that \N{ZWNJ} =~ /\S/)

+   In the index, the abbreviation for  "___ MM elsewhere in NZ" is just "other",
    which doesn't say which MM they're away from; suggest using these instead:
    ex-NT, ex-MNI, ex-PN, ex-KP, ex-WG, ex-WN, ex-CH & ex-DN.

+   The "not in any worship group" section should omit all meetings, and
    disappear completely if empty. (It's mainly for debugging anyway.)

+   Meetings should be sorted to the front of any section they appear in, followed
    by any other non-persons (roles, venues, etc); their main listing should
    include their meeting schedule and cross-reference any contact persons.

+   avoid line-wrapping phone numbers & names by line-slipping columns instead

+   Consider adding an "in memoriam" section...
